You are a senior business analyst for an e-commerce platform. You are provided with a summarized sample of {sample_size} customer sessions:

{summary_input}

Please analyze and generate insights across these dimensions:
1. Behavioral patterns: What are the common behaviors in converted vs abandoned sessions?
2. Drop-off points: Are there recurring steps where users disengage?
3. Search quality: Which searches led to product views or drop-offs?
4. Cart behavior: Are there products that frequently get abandoned?
5. Recommendations: Suggest 3â€“5 high-impact changes to improve conversion or product discovery.
6. Product Insights: Which products are viewed often but rarely purchased?
7. Search Gaps: Which searches returned few or no results and correlated with exits?
8. Repeated Actions: Any user sessions that suggest indecision or hesitation?
9. Price Barriers: At what price points do users typically abandon?
10. Device/Category Impact: Do certain devices or categories show stronger engagement?

Respond in clear bullet points.
